# Checkout a file from a specific branch during rebasing
#
# Example - if your current branch is feature/123,
# and you're rebasing it on top of master:
#
#   git checkout feature/123
#   git rebase master
#
# and run into conflicts on file: src/some/file.js
# You can revert this file to master's version with:
#
#   git checkout master -- src/some/file.js
#
# or use "ours" and "theirs" aliases:
#
#   git checkout --ours src/some/file.js
#   git checkout --theirs src/some/file.js
#

# #
# Show file difference between HEAD and another branch
#
#   git diff master src/some/file.js
